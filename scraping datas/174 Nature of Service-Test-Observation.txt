     174 - Nature of Service-Test-Observation

     P  Profile or battery consisting of many independent atomic observations (e.g., SMA12, electrolytes), usually done at one instrument on one specimen
     F  Functional procedure that may consist of one or more interrelated measures (e.g., glucose tolerance test, creatinine clearance), usually done at different times and/or on different specimens
     A  Atomic service/test/observation (test code or treatment code)
     S  Superset-a set of batteries or procedures ordered under a single code unit but processed as separate batteries (e.g., routines = CBC, UA, electrolytes)This set indicates that the code being described is used to order multiple service/test/observation b
     C  Single observation calculated via a rule or formula from other independent observations (e.g., Alveolar-arterial ratio, cardiac output)
